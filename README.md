:exclamation: For more information or details of each project, please contact me! nico.marquez@hotmail.com :email:
 
 Below you will find some steps for you to better understand my project and explore it:

**1) First, I think that the best thing would be to visit the Executive Summary which explains the introduction of the project, objectives, problems, resolution and all the necessary information so that anyone, with or without knowledge of Data science, can read it.:**

**5) As a freelancer I worked with the Balancor company and developed an electronic scale for field grains.**

This was a machine with a hopper and built-in load cells to fill bags of corn kernels with an exact weight:
